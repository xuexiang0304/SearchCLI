#Introduction

SearchCLI is a command line application which can search through provided data and display the search result.

#Assumptions
1. The relationship between given data.
The user's id is linked with ticket's submitter_id and assignee_id.
The organization's id linked with ticket's organization_id and user's organization_id.

2. Search constraints
The search is fine search which means it only matches the whole world. For example, if we search "am", it will not match "ample". Also, the search is case sensitive. For example, if we search "new york", "New York" will NOT be matched.

#Features
###1. Search through multiple data resource (users.json, tickets.json, organization) and return result at once.
There are three groups of results will be returned.
1. Users and the related tickets and organizations for each users in the result.
2. Tickets and related tickets and organizations for each ticket in the result.
3. Organizations and related users and tickets for each organization in the result.

###2. Search through users first and return the result and the related tickets and organizations for each user in the result.
There is only one group of result will be returned. See the example for search "admin" below, the result is showing a user information in the result:
There are 24 users show in the result

#Architecture Design
##Design Goal
###1.Qualities
The main design goals for this system are:
####Usability
End users shall be able to use this system easily without extensive training.
####Scalability
This system shall be able to scale in the future, such as add a new feature.
####Maintainability
The components of this system shall be able to modified without huge cost.
###2 Principle
1. High cohesion and low coupling to support maintainability and scalability.
2. Single-responsiblity principle — A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
3. Open-closed principle — Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
4. Liskov substitution principle — Every subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class.
5. Interface segregation principle — A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
6. Dependency Inversion Principle — Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
##High-Level Design
To achieve the goal of 'low coupling, high cohesion; open to extension, close to modification'. Layering Design and the design pattern for each layer have been applied.The application contains 5 main layers.
1. Presentation layer
Presentation layer is the entry point in this application which is in charge of interacting with users. Also, it interacts with the Service layer according to users' reaction. This layer plays an important role of separating the user interface with domain logics.
2. Service layer
Service layer interacts with the Presentation layer and Domain Logic layer which helps preventing exposing domain logics to the Presentation layer. Also, this layer can help sharing logic with multiple user interfaces without exposing domain logic details. Service layer gives the system more flexibilities to reuse domain logics.
In this search CLI, the system provides 4 services through this service layer without exposing domain logic details to the presentation layer.
3. Domain Logic layer
The domain logic layer aims to implement the business rules. For example, all the search processes happen in this layer. Domain model pattern has been implemented which provides high extensibility for the system. Additional modules or changes can be easily added into the system if needed in the future. Besides, the domain logic of the system is divided into different modules according to different models or related operations, relevant functions are grouped into one module, which performs high cohesion and low coupling between modules.
4. Entity
Entity layers is the layer to define all entities. There are 6 entities involved in the current system, including User, UserResult, Ticket, TicketResult, Organization, OrganizationResult. Those entities are used cross the system.
5. Data Layer
Data Layer takes care of fetching data from data source and converting to useful objects or entities. In this search CLI, the data sources are json files. In this layer, these data are converted to User, Ticket and Organization entities. Separating data layer from the domain logic layer makes it easier to debug and extend the ways to get data. Same domain logics can be applied for data from different data resource, so it can improve the reusability as well.
